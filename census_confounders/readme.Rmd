This directory is an premade structure that can be directly cloned from github
to serve as a starting structure for new projects done as part of the team. This document
will provide basic instructions on how to use this template to get started on your project.

# Downloading this repository

You can copy this repository directly from github to a directory of your choice using the following
command:
```{bash, eval = F}
git clone https://github.com/NSAPH/project_template.git <NEW_PROJECT_NAME>
```
You will likely need to set up an rsa key on your code.harvard.edu account to use the remote git features.
You can find information on how to set that up [here](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.12/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). You will need at least one key set up for each computer you are working on.

TODO:

Confirm the location (github vs code.harvard.edu)

# Setting up Git

After initially cloning the repository, the downloaded repository will be connected to the template repository. In order
to set up your own project, you will first need to disconnect the repository from the project template remote repository.
Use the following command:
```
git remote rm origin
```

You will then need to set up your own repository for the project.
First, create an empty repository (make sure to not include the readme.md option that github suggests) for your project,
either on github or on code.harvard.edu. We recommend using code.harvard.edu, as it will make all materials only available within
Harvard rather than fully open to the public. If you would like to make your repository public at a later date, copying it from
code.harvard.edu to github is fairly straightforward. 

Next, run the following lines to connect the template to the new repository:

Connecting to a code.harvard.edu repository:
```
git remote add origin git@code.harvard.edu:<username>/<repository_name>.git
git push -u origin master
```

Connecting to a github repository:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<project>.git
git push -u origin master
```

You can then use git as you normally would.

# Other initial setup
The readmes (including this file) will pertain to the project template not to your project. You should edit them (and remove extra files)
so that they describe what the intent of your research project is.


# The .gitignore file 

The following is the default .gitignore file included in the directory.
```{r, message = F}
cat(scan(".gitignore", what="character"), sep = "\n")
```

The .gitignore file tells git which files it should ignore. Files listed in the .gitignore will not have their changes tracked and will not
be uploaded to the remote server. This is useful as we want to avoid
tracking large files (such as data files, which are also frequently sensitive and shouldn't be stored on less secure systems
like github). If there are other files you would like to avoid tracking, edit the .gitignore file to add their name.

# Directories
- `code`
  - The code directory should be used to store all code used as part of the project. If there are a large number of code files
  additional directories within the `code` directory are recommended, especially if there are multiple workflows. There should also
  be a description of the order code should be run in, or some other description of the contents and a method of indicating the workflow.
- `data`
  - This directory should contain all raw data and processed data used by a given project.
  All csv and rds files within this directory are assumed to be large and by default are not tracked by git. If there
  are a large number of data files additional internal structure is recommended. The `.gitignore` file will need to be 
  updated if more structure is used. One common paradign is to have a `data/raw_data` directory storing unedited files
  as receinved from the source and a `data/analysis_data` folder containing the assembled and cleaned data ready for use with
  models.
- `figures`
  - This directory should contain all of the figures generated through the course of reaserch. The readme file in this directory
  should list the files, have a brief discription of the figures, and list the file that creates the figure. This directory should
  be tracked by git.
- `reports`
  - This directory should contain Rmarkdown files used to summarize and describe reserach processes and 
  data features. The HTML or PDF outputs of the markdown files should also be stored in this
  directory. This directory should be tracked by git.
- `results`
  - This directory should be used to store objects such as models, tables, or other similar products of analysis.
  Whether or not files in this directory should be tracked by github is a question of their size and sensitivity
  and likely varies by project. By default, .RDS files in this directory will not be tracked, but all other
  files will.
